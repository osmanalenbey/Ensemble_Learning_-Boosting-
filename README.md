## Overview
This repository provides an intuitive and mathematical understanding of **boosting algorithms**, a key concept in ensemble learning. Boosting methods iteratively improve weak learners by minimizing error from previous iterations, creating a strong predictive model. The notebook walks through the foundational principles of boosting, including:

- The general concept of **ensemble learning** and how boosting differs from other ensemble types
- A mathematical **derivation of boosting** and how residual-based updates lead to performance gains
- Implementation insights into well-known boosting algorithms like **AdaBoost** and **Gradient Boosting**.

## What's Inside the Notebook?
- **Introduction to Ensemble Learning**: Understanding bagging, stacking, and boosting
- **Intuition Behind Boosting**: A toy example that becomes separable using boosting
- **Mathematical Justification**: Derivation of why or how boosting guarantees improvement
- **Implementation Details**: Exploring different boosting methods

The notebook is structured to provide both **theoretical insights** and **practical explanations**, making it useful for researchers and practitioners.

## Usage
Simply open the Jupyter Notebook and follow along with the explanations. You can modify or extend the provided code to experiment with different datasets and boosting parameters.
